# Advanced Logger Example Project

This example project demonstrates how to integrate and use the `advanced-logger-example` package, a flexible and customizable logging library for Node.js applications. Through this example, you'll see how to log messages of various severities and how to configure the logger for different output formats and destinations.

## `Getting Started`

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### `Prerequisites`

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v10 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### `Installing`

To set up the example project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (or download the ZIP file and extract it):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ara-miri/Advanced-Logger-Example.git
cd advanced-logger-example
```
#### `Install Dependencies:`
Navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
npm install
```
This command installs all necessary dependencies, including the `advanced-logger-example` package.
### `Running the Example`
With the dependencies installed, you can run the example script to see the logger in action:
```bash
node src/index.js
```
This command executes the script in `src/index.js`, which uses the `advanced-logger-example` to log messages. You'll see output in the console or in a file, depending on the logger's configuration in the script.
### `Understanding the Example`
The example script in `src/index.js` demonstrates several key features of the `advanced-logger-example` package, including:

- Logging messages with different severities (`info, warn, error`).

- Configuring the logger to output messages to the console or a file (if supported by your package).
You can modify the script to experiment with other features and configurations of the `advanced-logger-example`.
